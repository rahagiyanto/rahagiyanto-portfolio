👋 Hello, I'm Angga Rahagiyanto

I'm a PhD student in intelligent systems, a multidisciplinary developer, and lifelong learner with a passion for EMG signal processing, wearable robotics, and human augmentation. I build tools, prototypes, and algorithms that bridge the human body and machines to make a real-world impact.

⚡ Fun fact about me: You may see me struggle, but you will never see me quit.

🎯 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- EMG-based control systems
- Exploring deep learning for biosignals
- Web3 and mobile application development for integrated sensor platforms

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Python for EMG signal analysis and research automation
- 3D design using Fusion 360 for wearable prototyping
- Deep learning for signal classification and motion control
- Mechatronics: integrating sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers

📁 About This Repository

This repository serves as a log of my projects, experiments, and learning journey. I will (try) to make documentation with a technical note in my weekly progress tracking and experiment documentation. 
Inside, you'll find:
- What I am learning about 💬
- What I found when I am learning about many things 💬
- Technical notes and documentation 💬

🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm always open to discussions, learning together, and building something meaningful. If you're interested in collaborating or simply want to exchange ideas (based on what I do, hehe), feel free to reach out.

📫 How to reach me:
As you can see in my profile. 😄

Website/Blog: soon!

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
